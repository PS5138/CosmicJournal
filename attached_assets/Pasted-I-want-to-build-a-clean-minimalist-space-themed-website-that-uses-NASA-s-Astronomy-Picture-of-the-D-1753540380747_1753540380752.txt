I want to build a clean, minimalist space-themed website that uses NASA’s Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API to display a new astronomical image or video each day. The site should act like a personal space journal — a simple, immersive experience where users can explore visually stunning cosmic content curated daily by NASA. On page load, the site should automatically fetch and display the current day’s Astronomy Picture of the Day, along with the title, the date it was published, and the explanatory text provided by NASA. This content should be central and prominent on the page, with an elegant, dark-themed aesthetic to match the feel of deep space — dark backgrounds, white or soft-colored text, and smooth typography.

Below the main image or video, users should see a “Show Another Random Image” button. When clicked, this button should fetch a random image or video from the APOD archive and dynamically update the content on the page without requiring a full reload. If the content is a video (e.g., a YouTube embed), it should be rendered in a responsive iframe. This allows the site to function like a visual discovery tool — a sort of cosmic shuffle button for users who want to explore the universe in bite-sized moments.

To enhance the journal feel, I want the layout to feel reflective and calming. The image should have a max-width constraint with rounded corners and subtle shadows. Text should wrap cleanly below, maintaining legibility on all screen sizes. I also want basic error handling — if the NASA API is down or returns an error, the site should display a graceful error message informing the user.

Optionally, I’d like a lightweight loading state or animation to indicate when new content is being fetched — ideally something simple like rotating stars or a minimal spinner. The site should be fully responsive and usable on mobile and desktop alike. There’s no need for user accounts, backend storage, or databases — just a static site that pulls in and displays NASA’s content beautifully.

Overall, this should feel like a meditative space diary — a window into the cosmos that anyone can open daily for a moment of wonder.
